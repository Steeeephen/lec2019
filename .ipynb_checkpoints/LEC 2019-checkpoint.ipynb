    "2019 was a landmark year for the League of Legends Europeans Championship; Franchising was introduced which brought a multitude of new and old teams into the league. G2 Esports took home Europe's first major trophy since before the arrival of Chinese/Korean teams to the scene. Three fully-European teams were sent to the World Championship and all three made it out of groups for the first time in the league's history. G2 Esports were well beaten at the final hurdle, but the year was nonetheless a raging success. In this notebook I aim to gather data on the domestic league and show some of the interesting aspects of the year."
